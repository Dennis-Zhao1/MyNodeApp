## 🚀 Deployment Architecture

This Node.js app is deployed on **AWS App Runner** using a custom **Docker image** stored in **Amazon ECR**.

### 🧱 Architecture
1. The Node app is containerized with Docker and pushed to **ECR**.
2. AWS **App Runner** is configured to automatically deploy whenever a new image is pushed to ECR.
3. A **custom domain** (`www.example.com`) is mapped to the App Runner service for production traffic.
4. **GitHub + AWS CodeBuild** handles CI/CD:
   - When code is pushed to the `main` branch, CodeBuild automatically builds a new Docker image and pushes it to ECR.
   - App Runner automatically deploys the new image without manual intervention.
